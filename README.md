# pathScraper
pathScraper is a webscraper written with Node.js to scrape pathfinder 2e information.
Readme will be updated once more of the project is done and I get a better picture of what this will end up being.

## Usage

Using the scrapers is fairly simple and what you do with the information scraped after is up to you. This scraper is only to gain the data and return it as json objects. 
In order to use this you will need to run the scraper via command line.
